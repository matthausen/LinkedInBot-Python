# LinkedIn Bot

This python bot lets you login into your Linkedin account and automatically navigates to people and jobs profiles which appear in your network.
Ideal if you need to amplify your network or apply for jobs.


LinkedIn does not like bots and blocks them once they have been spotted.
That is why this bot can visit a profile for a random period of 2.5 to 6.9 seconds. So that no repetitive behaviour is found.
